# (Release, InRelease, Release.gpg, per-arch Packages/Release, by-hash/) and the
# pool entries it references straight into ${OUTPUT_DIR} with their ORIGINAL
# signatures, then exclude the suite from the re-includedeb/re-export loop
# (Step 4) and the by-hash + re-sign loop (Step 4b). Re-exporting an unchanged
# suite would regenerate its Release Date + signature even though its package
# content is identical, reopening the Acquire-By-Hash CDN hash-mismatch window
# this bolt-on exists to prevent. Serving the tree verbatim keeps the suite's
# Release Date / InRelease / Release.gpg byte-identical.
#
# VERBATIM_SUITES holds the non-target suites we successfully mirrored verbatim
# (the bare aliases on a 26.04 publish, plus any versioned non-target suite with
# a live tree). On a 24.04 publish the bare alias is a PUBLISH TARGET (D-12) so
# it is never in OTHER_SUITES and never verbatim-mirrored — it is fed fresh by
# repo_manage.sh exactly as before. When the live alias tree 404s (first deploy /
# empty-2604, D-14) the verbatim copy no-ops cleanly and the suite stays empty.

# rebuild of that version would OVERWRITE the shared pool .deb that another suite's
# already-signed index still checksums, desyncing that suite's metadata from the
# pool. An identical filename means an identical (source, version, arch), which in
# apt's model MUST be identical bytes; so if the pool already carries this exact

<h1>Podman Isolated for Ubuntu — APT Repository</h1>
<p>Pre-built standalone <code>.deb</code> packages for isolated upstream Podman on Ubuntu (amd64 &amp; arm64). Packages install into <code>/opt/podman/releases/&lt;version&gt;/</code> with companion symlinks in <code>/usr/local/bin/</code>, allowing seamless cohabitation with Ubuntu system packages.</p>

<h2>Choose a Track</h2>

track is distro-qualified only — always use <code>v5-2404</code> / <code>v5-2604</code>).
