# Ubuntu-only integration harness: real reprepro/gpg assemble of the multi-suite
# repository, by-hash + re-sign post-processing, and the no-clobber property.
#
# This proves the production-critical behaviors that Plans 01-03 could only
# author on macOS (no reprepro/gpg/apt there):
#   - REPO-08: Acquire-By-Hash: yes in every populated suite's Release, a
#     by-hash/<ALGO>/<hash> copy adjacent to each index, and a valid GPG
#     signature chain (InRelease clearsign + Release.gpg detached) AFTER the
#     by-hash mutation re-signs Release.
#   - Criterion 4 (no-clobber): publishing one suite leaves another populated
#     suite's Packages index byte-identical.
#   - REPO-06: the empty-but-signed -2604 suite (stable-2604) exports a Release
#     and verifies even with zero packages (D-14).
#   - A1 confirmation: record which hash algorithms reprepro actually emitted and
#     assert by-hash exists for at least the strongest one.
#
# Platform note: this harness is Ubuntu-only. reprepro + gpg + dpkg-deb are
# required. On the macOS dev host (no reprepro/dpkg-deb) the harness prints SKIP
# and exits 0 — mirroring the dpkg-dependent skip convention in
# tests/test_detect_distro_depends.sh. Run it on the Lima ubuntu-24 VM / CI.
