# test_docs_suites.sh - doc-grep assertions over docs/apt-repository.md (MIGR-01/MIGR-03).
#
# Asserts the six distro-qualified suite names, the single Signed-By keyring path,
# the migration section header, and the verbatim deprecation phrase are present, and
# that the CI-internal `trusted=yes` smoke-test shortcut never leaks into the
# user-facing docs (T-22-DOC-01 security boundary).
#
# Run via `bash tests/test_docs_suites.sh`. Also auto-run in CI via the
# "Run doc and HTML unit tests" step in the publish job (WR-05).
